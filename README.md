# AdaptiveLSH
Prototype implementation of Adaptive Locality Sensitive Hashing for the problem of Top-K Entity Resolution (ER).
Technical report: http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/1157/

The main functionality for Adaptive LSH can be found in the core package.  
This repository also contains a number of different ER matching rules, dataset preprocessing algorithms, 
and ER algorithms, we have tried, which are not discussed in the paper and technical report.
